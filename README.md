1. In your rescue folder and create a new subfolder named css. Inside the new css directory, create a new file called styles.css.

Add a link to your style sheet in the index.html, about.html, contact.html, and template.html files. Nest the link within the head element, below the meta element.

2. In your styles.css file, add one multiline comment that includes your name as the author, the current date, and the file name, like so:

 /*  
Author: Student Name 
File Name: styles.css
Date: MM/DD/YYYY
*/

3. Add a blank line after the comment then add a new comment with the text CSS Reset, followed by a CSS reset style rule that sets the margin, padding, and borders to zero for the following selectors: body, header, nav, main, footer, img, h1, h3.
4. Add a blank line after the CSS reset style rule, add a comment with the text Style rules for body and images, and then create new style rules for the body and img selectors.

Create a style rule for the body selector that sets a background color value of #f6eee4.
Create a style rule for the img selector that sets a max-width to 100% and displays images as a block.

5. Add a blank line after the img style rule, add a comment with the text Style rules for navigation area, and then create the following style rules for the nav, nav ul, nav li, and nav li a selectors:

Create a style rule for nav ul that sets the list style type to none, sets the margin to 0, and aligns text center.
Create a style rule for nav li that sets the display to an inline-block, sets a font size of 1.5em, sets a font family value of Geneva, Arial, sans-serif, and sets a font weight value of bold.
